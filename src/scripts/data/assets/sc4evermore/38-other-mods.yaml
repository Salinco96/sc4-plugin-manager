If you don't see the clouds/rain at all after that, you may have to bulldoze the lot and place it somewhere else as the effect may be out of bounds, this isn't something that I have control over since the effect is on a lot and has no way of running on its own.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Plop Cost:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">$10,000</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Monthly Cost:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">$1,000</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Monthly Income:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">N/A</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Menu Location:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">Water Utilities, Gizmo_Weather_Plant</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Lot Size:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">6 x 7</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Lot Effects:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">-500 water pollution in a 75 tile radius, 7500 water produced,<br>100 power consumed, and 500 water consumed.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<table class=\"style10\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"style15\" style=\"width: 140px;\">Requirements:</td>\r\n<td class=\"style15\">Power, water and road connections.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n<p class=\"style18\"><span class=\"style24\"><strong>Installation</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"style18\"><span class=\"style24\">To install this mod, put the extracted file or folder into your C:My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder and follow any directions above, if any were listed. <br>To uninstall the mod, simply move or delete the file or folder you extracted from your C:My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder.</span></p> </div>\r\n        <div class=\"jd_preview\" style=\"\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"jd_preview\" style=\"\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"jd_screenshot_zone jd_clear\" style=\"\">\r\n            <span class=\"jd_screenshot\"> </span>\r\n            <span class=\"jd_screenshot\"> </span>\r\n            <span class=\"jd_screenshot\"> </span>\r\n        </div> \r\n</body>"
